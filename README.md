# React App - Created by Ali Haider (@chhadi05)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project

A beginner-friendly React project built to explore and implement modern web development practices. I'm currently enhancing my skills in **React**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Web Development**.

If you’re a developer or cybersecurity enthusiast, feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page reloads when you make changes, and errors will appear in the console.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
